# This Python 3 script allows the user to filter the ortholog files, resulting from the output created 
# with Orthofinder 2.5.5 by Emms, D.M. et al. (2019), from Orthogroups.GeneCount.tsv to a new folder 
# based on the number of individual copies and on the percentage of missing taxa per file. This script 
# will make use of the file structure created by OrthoFinder 2.5.5, it might not work for other versions.
